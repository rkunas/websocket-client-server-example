# websocket-client-server-example

This example is to understand websocket with Spring.
We have the Client and the Server. Both of them are Spring Boot Applications, but with different Ports.

The Client Spring Boot is Running with port 8891

The Server Spring Boot is Running with port 8892

These Ports are defined in the two application.properties Files.

Ok what now ?

1. Clone the Project.

2. Open The Projects in some IDE

3. Start both Spring Boot Applications
